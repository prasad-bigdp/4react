In React, you can deal the forms in two ways
i. using state 
ii. using useRef
Based on approach, React divides components as two types
i. controlled components
ii. uncontrolled components
i. controlled components: These components uses state to store or access inputs values. user can control these components.


const [n,setN]=useState('')


<form>
   <input type="text" plaeholder="Enter text" value={n} onChange={(e)=>setN("prasad")} />
</form>

ii. unControlled components: In unControlled Components, the value will be takes using DOM. we use a hook called useRef to do DOM Manipulations.

const name=useRef('')
<form>
   <input type="text" plaeholder="Enter text" ref={name}/>
</form>

React uses libraries to handle forms like react hook form or formik
for validation , we use libraries like zod,yup etc..,
