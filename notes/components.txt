React Components are the building blocks of React application.
by default, React application creates a root component called App.
A component is a small, reusable piece of code that represents a UI element. components are flexible, modular and reusable
React Provides two kinds of components
 i. functional components:
    what is a functional component?
       functional component also called stateless component that are simple components which receives props and returns JSX.
    How to create our own functional components?
       create a file functional-component-name.jsx and add a function which return an UI and export the function
       const Header = () =>
       {
        return (
        <h2>My Website</h2>
        )
       } 
       export default Header
       It is recommanded to have same name for component similar to file name. 
    Inside SRC, create a file with properNAME(starts with uppercase letter), you can keep all pcomponents in one single application
    How to use functional components?
      import functional components into other components and use them as HTML elements
    nested components:
       A component inside another component is called nested component
          //App.jsx
          <Header />
     
     props: props are used to send the values from parent components to child component. props is shortform of "properties"
     we send properties as attributes and receives the properties as parameters of function
     eg:
       //App.jsx
       <Header name="PRASAD" />
       //Header.jsx
       function Header(props){
         return (
            <h2>{props.name}</p>
         )

       }

       props is always an object of properties
